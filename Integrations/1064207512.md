The iAuditor API gives you direct access to your data in the iAuditor platform. Using the API, you can interact with your organization’s actions data in a range of ways. Including the ability to search and retrieve, as well as create and update actions.

This article shows you how to interact with actions in your organization via the iAuditor API.

## Before you begin

Keep in mind that you must be on our [Premium subscription](https://safetyculture.com/pricing/) in order to generate an [iAuditor API token](https://help.safetyculture.com/en_us/1063650457-rkCBKDK4P) and use the API.

Please note, as we improve iAuditor and introduce new features, there may be two versions or experiences of the same feature at the same time. Currently, there are two experiences of the Actions feature in iAuditor. Whilst most organizations are now on the new experience, referred to as “Collaborative Actions”, some are still on the old experience, referred to as “Legacy Actions”.

This article covers the API for the Collaborative Actions experience. You can find out which experience you are on via the steps below.
1. Log in to the iAuditor web app.
2. Select "Actions" from the menu on the left-hand side.
3. If you see “+ Create action” on the upper-right corner of the page, this means that your organization is on the **Collaborative Actions** experience.</br><img src="https://support.safetyculture.com/wp-content/media/2019/12/Actions-experience-1536x889.png">- [How to interact with actions via the iAuditor API (beta)]

|Setting |Description |Example |
| --- | --------- | --- |
| token (**mandatory**) | Your [iAuditor API token](https://help.safetyculture.com/en_us/1063650457-rkCBKDK4P). | `de8g4e68bg3acb983b5211...` |
| ssl_cert |  |  |
| ssl_verify |  |  |
| proxy_http | If you use a proxy, set the HTTP traffic. Please note that both HTTP and HTTPS must be filled out if one is used. | `10.1.5.80` |
| proxy_https | If you use a proxy, set the HTTPS traffic. Please note that both HTTP and HTTPS must be filled out if one is used. | `10.1.5.80` |
| config_name (**mandatory**) | The configuration name, which by default uses `iauditor`. This is useful if you're managing multiple configurations as the config_name would be used to name files and organize folders.<br/><br/>Do not use any spaces in the name. | `iauditor` |
| export_path | Specifies the absolute or relative path to the directory on where to save exported data. This applies to all formats except for SQL. | `C:\Documents\iAuditor\` |
| filename | Specifies the inspection item ID to use for naming PDF or Word exports. This must be a single question item that uses a text response in the Title Page (header_items) of the inspection. Learn how to [retrieve question item IDs](https://help.safetyculture.com/1064338729-SyqNuPYND). | `f3245d43-ea77-11e1-aff1-0800200c9a66` |
| export_archived | Determines the inspections to export. By default, this is set to `false`, which exports only unarchived inspections. Use `true` to only export archived inspections or `both` for both unarchived and archived inspections. | `true` or `false` or `both` |
| export_completed | Determines the inspections to export. By default, this is set to `true`, which exports only completed inspections. Use `false` to only export incomplete inspections or `both` for both completed and incomplete inspections. | `true` or `false` or `both` |
| use_real_template_name | Specifies whether to use the template name for CSV exports or not. By default, this is set to `false`, which uses the template ID as the CSV file name. Use `true` to set template names as CSV file names.<br/><br/>We recommend that you only use `true` for one-off exports, as if a template is renamed, a new file would be created. Also, exports would result in an error if you have templates with the same name.<br/><br/>You can also use `single_file` to consolidate all CSV exports to a single CSV file rather than across different templates. | `true` or `false` or `single_file` |
| export_inactive_items | Specifies whether to include question items that are inactive to CSV exports or not. This is relevant to templates that use [Logic fields](https://help.safetyculture.com/1063912808-Hyoj7dFEP) (smartfield), where question items that are nested under Logic fields would be inactive if the condition is not satisfied. By default, this is set to `false`, which does not include inactive items. Use `true` to include inactive items in CSV exports. This setting is forced to `true` for SQL exports and when the `merge_rows` setting is set to `true`.<br/><br/>Please note that this setting can only be set *before* the database table is created. If you need to change this setting at a later date, drop the table first and allow it to be recreated. | `true` or `false` |
| preferences | Specifies the [Report Preference](https://help.safetyculture.com/1064174422-BkeAqPF4D) to use for PDF or Word exports. Run `ia_exporter --list preferences` to list Report Preference IDs that are available to all templates or run `ia_exporter --list preferences template_id` to list template-specific Report Preferences IDs as well. | `22af6c2b-e279-40b1-874f-0a4340930b6f` |
| template_ids | Specifies the template(s) from which to export inspections. By default, this is left blank to export all available data. You can supply multiple template IDs, separated by commas. | `template_123,template_456` |
| sync_delay_in_seconds | Determines the time in seconds to wait after completing one export run, before running again. By default, this is set to `900`. | `900` |
| media_sync_offset_in_seconds | Determines the time in seconds since an inspection has been modified before it would be synced. By default, this is set to `900`. | `900` |
| merge_rows | Specifies whether to update existing rows to CSV exports or not when an inspection is updated after it gets exported. By default, this is set to `false`, where new rows are created in the CSV export even if an inspection was exported already.<br/><br/>Please note that setting this to `true` can affect the export speed, enlarge the dataset, and cause increased database requests. You should review the [database model](https://github.com/jackihann/iauditor-exporter/wiki/Database-model) and learn how this works before enabling the setting. | `true` or `false` |
| actions_merge_rows | This setting works in the same way as the `merge_rows` setting, only that this applies to actions instead. | `true` or `false` |
| sql_table | The name of the table to store iAuditor data. You don't have to create the table beforehand as running the iAuditor Exporter tool creates the table for you in the specified name. | `iauditor_data` |
| database_type | The database type. The iAuditor Exporter tool includes support for SQL, PostgreSQL, and MySQL databases. Specify the database type accordingly. | `sql` |
| database_user | The username you use to log in to your database. | `iauditor` |
| database_pwd | Your database password. | `p455w0rd` |
| database_server | The server where your database is located. | `localhost` |
| database_port | The port your database is listening on. This is usually 1433 for SQL databases. | `1433` |
| database_schema |  |  |
| database_name | The database name. You must define the driver to use if required. For SQL, you can use `MyDatabase?driver=ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server`, replacing `MyDatabase` with your database name. For MySQL, you only need to specify the database name. | `iAuditor` |
