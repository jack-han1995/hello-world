# How to interact with actions via the iAuditor API (beta)

The iAuditor API gives you direct access to your data in the iAuditor platform. Using the API, you can interact with your organization’s actions data in a range of ways. Including the ability to search and retrieve, as well as create and update actions.

This article shows you how to interact with actions in your organization via the iAuditor API.

## Before you begin

Keep in mind that you must be on our [Premium subscription](https://safetyculture.com/pricing/) in order to generate an [iAuditor API token](https://help.safetyculture.com/en_us/1063650457-rkCBKDK4P) and use the API.

Please note, as we improve iAuditor and introduce new features, there may be two versions or experiences of the same feature at the same time. Currently, there are two experiences of the Actions feature in iAuditor. Whilst most organizations are now on the new experience, referred to as “Collaborative Actions”, some are still on the old experience, referred to as “Legacy Actions”.

This article covers the API for the Collaborative Actions experience. You can find out which experience you are on via the steps below.
1. Log in to the iAuditor web app.
2. Select "Actions" from the menu on the left-hand side.
3. If you see “+ Create action” on the upper-right corner of the page, this means that your organization is on the **Collaborative Actions** experience.
