<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">As part of our mission to empower frontline workers, iAuditor users can <a href="https://help.safetyculture.com/en_us/1064469394-ryQeMvFNv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">create actions</a> on the go and <a href="https://help.safetyculture.com/en_us/1188593813-B1haQlJIv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">capture observations and information about issues</a> as soon as they occur. However, we understand that not all users in your organization require the full set of iAuditor features. Rather, some might just need to be involved to complete actions, flag observations, or resolve issues. That&rsquo;s why we introduced user seats or licenses that are feature-specific, allowing you to have <span data-id="d1e80772-6439-4fc7-95fa-eac5c75094c7" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-mark-type="annotation">actions only, issues only, or actions and issues only</span> users for a considerably lower price.</p>
<p>This article shows you how to add and remove actions only, issues only, or actions and issues only user seats or licenses for your organization on the web app.</p>
<h2>Before you begin</h2>
<p>Please note that user seats or licenses can only be added on the web app, by administrators or users with the &ldquo;Billing Management&rdquo; permission. Learn more about <a href="https://help.safetyculture.com/en_us/1064273113-Hyv7g_tVv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">permissions</a> and how you can assign them as an administrator.</p>
<p>We currently offer the following feature-specific user seats for organizations on our annual subscription only. If your organization is on our monthly subscription, you can <a href="https://help.safetyculture.com/en_us/1470890172-H1fYbVFNv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">switch your monthly subscription to an annual subscription</a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Actions only</li>
    <li>Issues only</li>
    <li>Actions and issues only</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that you must already have feature-specific user seats set up by your account manager, to be able to add additional user seats by yourself. If you don&rsquo;t have any currently set up, you can reach out to your account manager or our <a href="mailto:sales@safetyculture.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">business development team</a> to get started.</p>
